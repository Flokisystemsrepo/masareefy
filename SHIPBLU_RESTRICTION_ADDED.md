# 🚢 **SHIPBLU RESTRICTION ADDED - PROFESSIONAL PLAN ONLY**

## ✅ **Problem Solved**

The user requested that the Shipblu tab should also have the same behavior as Bosta and Shopify tabs - appearing normally but showing an upgrade modal and blurring content when clicked by non-Professional users. This has been **completely implemented**.

## 🔧 **What Was Implemented**

### **1. Subscription Context Update (`src/contexts/SubscriptionContext.tsx`)**

- ✅ **Added Shipblu to Locked Features**: Added "shipblu" to the locked features list for Starter plan
- ✅ **Integration Access**: Shipblu now requires Professional plan access via `hasIntegrationAccess("shipblu")`

### **2. Tab Click Handler (`src/pages/brand/Integrations.tsx`)**

- ✅ **Click Detection**: Added Shipblu tab click detection in the `onValueChange` handler
- ✅ **Modal Trigger**: Non-Professional users see upgrade modal when clicking Shipblu tab
- ✅ **Tab Prevention**: Tab doesn't switch for restricted users

### **3. Content Display**

- ✅ **Blurred Content**: Shipblu tab content is blurred for non-Professional users
- ✅ **Overlay**: Professional upgrade prompt overlays the blurred content
- ✅ **Pointer Events**: Blurred content is not interactive (pointer-events-none)

### **4. Upgrade Modal Integration**

- ✅ **Feature-Specific**: Shows "Shipblu Integration" in upgrade modal
- ✅ **Consistent Design**: Same professional upgrade modal as Bosta and Shopify
- ✅ **Pricing Display**: Clear 499 EGP/month pricing

## 🎯 **How It Works**

### **Subscription Plan Detection**

```typescript
// Shipblu is now restricted to Professional plan only
const lockedFeatures = [
  "shopify",
  "bosta",
  "shipblu", // ← Added Shipblu
  "business insights",
  "smart insights",
  "advanced analytics",
];
```

### **Tab Click Handler**

```typescript
onValueChange={(value) => {
  if (value === "shopify" && !hasIntegrationAccess("shopify")) {
    setUpgradeFeature("Shopify Integration");
    setShowUpgradeModal(true);
    return;
  }
  if (value === "bosta" && !hasIntegrationAccess("bosta")) {
    setUpgradeFeature("Bosta Integration");
    setShowUpgradeModal(true);
    return;
  }
  if (value === "shipblu" && !hasIntegrationAccess("shipblu")) {  // ← Added Shipblu
    setUpgradeFeature("Shipblu Integration");
    setShowUpgradeModal(true);
    return;
  }
  setActiveTab(value);
}}
```

### **Content Blurring**

```typescript
<TabsContent value="shipblu" className="space-y-6 relative">
  <div
    className={`${
      !hasIntegrationAccess("shipblu") ? "blur-sm pointer-events-none" : ""
    }`}
  >
    {/* Full Shipblu import functionality */}
  </div>
  {!hasIntegrationAccess("shipblu") && (
    <div className="absolute inset-0 flex items-center justify-center bg-white/80 backdrop-blur-sm rounded-lg">
      {/* Upgrade prompt overlay */}
    </div>
  )}
</TabsContent>
```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Files Modified**
