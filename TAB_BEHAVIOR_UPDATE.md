# 🎯 **TAB BEHAVIOR UPDATE - MODAL & BLUR APPROACH**

## ✅ **Problem Solved**

The user requested that Bosta and Shopify tabs should appear normally (not disabled), but when clicked by non-Professional users, they should show an upgrade modal and blur the tab content. This has been **completely implemented**.

## 🔧 **What Was Implemented**

### **1. Tab Appearance**
- ✅ **Normal Tabs**: Bosta and Shopify tabs now appear normally (not disabled)
- ✅ **Clickable**: All tabs are clickable and responsive
- ✅ **Visual Consistency**: No visual indication that tabs are restricted

### **2. Click Behavior**
- ✅ **Access Check**: When clicked, tabs check if user has Professional plan access
- ✅ **Modal Trigger**: Non-Professional users see upgrade modal instead of tab content
- ✅ **Tab Prevention**: Tab doesn't actually switch for restricted users

### **3. Content Display**
- ✅ **Blurred Content**: Tab content is blurred for non-Professional users
- ✅ **Overlay**: Professional upgrade prompt overlays the blurred content
- ✅ **Pointer Events**: Blurred content is not interactive (pointer-events-none)

### **4. Upgrade Modal**
- ✅ **Professional Design**: Clean, modern upgrade modal
- ✅ **Feature-Specific**: Shows specific feature name being restricted
- ✅ **Pricing Display**: Clear 499 EGP/month pricing
- ✅ **Call-to-Action**: "Upgrade Now" and "Maybe Later" buttons

## 🎯 **How It Works**

### **Tab Click Handler**
```typescript
onValueChange={(value) => {
  if (value === "shopify" && !hasIntegrationAccess("shopify")) {
    setUpgradeFeature("Shopify Integration");
    setShowUpgradeModal(true);
    return; // Prevents tab switch
  }
  if (value === "bosta" && !hasIntegrationAccess("bosta")) {
    setUpgradeFeature("Bosta Integration");
    setShowUpgradeModal(true);
    return; // Prevents tab switch
  }
  setActiveTab(value); // Normal tab switch for allowed users
}}
```

### **Content Blurring**
```typescript
<TabsContent value="shopify" className="space-y-6 relative">
  <div className={`${!hasIntegrationAccess("shopify") ? "blur-sm pointer-events-none" : ""}`}>
    {/* Full Shopify import functionality */}
  </div>
  {!hasIntegrationAccess("shopify") && (
    <div className="absolute inset-0 flex items-center justify-center bg-white/80 backdrop-blur-sm rounded-lg">
      {/* Upgrade prompt overlay */}
    </div>
  )}
</TabsContent>
```

### **Upgrade Modal**
```typescript
<Dialog open={showUpgradeModal} onOpenChange={setShowUpgradeModal}>
  <DialogContent className="max-w-md">
    <DialogHeader>
      <DialogTitle>Professional Plan Required</DialogTitle>
      <DialogDescription>Upgrade to access {upgradeFeature}</DialogDescription>
    </DialogHeader>
    <div className="text-center py-6">
      <h3>Unlock {upgradeFeature}</h3>
      <p>{getLockedFeatureMessage(upgradeFeature)}</p>
      <div className="bg-blue-50 rounded-lg p-4 mb-6">
        <div className="text-2xl font-bold text-blue-600">499 EGP/month</div>
        <div className="text-sm text-gray-600">Professional Plan</div>
      </div>
      <Button>Upgrade Now</Button>
      <Button variant="outline">Maybe Later</Button>
    </div>
  </DialogContent>
</Dialog>
```
