# Inventory Limit Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the complete implementation of inventory limits (100 items for Starter plan) with proper synchronization between usage tracking, stat cards, and upgrade flow.

## âœ… What Has Been Fixed

### 1. **Limit Checking Before Adding Items**
- The "Manual Entry" button now checks the inventory limit before opening the modal
- If limit is reached, shows upgrade modal instead of add item modal
- Added proper error handling with fallback to upgrade modal

### 2. **Stat Card Synchronization** 
- Statistics cards now display accurate counts from `inventoryCount` (actual data)
- Total Items card shows current/limit format (e.g., "95 / 100")
- Color-coded remaining count (red when at limit, yellow when near limit, green when available)
- Real-time synchronization with usage tracking system

### 3. **Usage Tracking Improvements**
- Enhanced `useInventoryUsage` hook to handle different API response formats
- Improved `useUsageTracking` with better error handling and performance optimizations
- Added automatic background sync when counts are out of sync
- Increased cache times to reduce API calls (60s stale time, 5min refetch interval)

### 4. **CRUD Operations Integration**
- All inventory mutations now trigger usage sync after success
- Create operation checks limit before proceeding
- Delete operations update usage counts automatically
- Bulk operations handle usage synchronization

### 5. **Upgrade Flow Integration**
- Upgrade modal properly configured with current inventory count and limit
- Modal shows correct resource type ("inventory")
- Professional plan benefits clearly displayed
- Proper error handling when API calls fail

## ðŸ”§ Key Components Modified

### Frontend Files:
- `/src/pages/brand/Inventory.tsx` - Main inventory page with limit checking
- `/src/hooks/useInventoryUsage.ts` - Enhanced inventory-specific usage tracking
- `/src/hooks/useUsageTracking.ts` - Improved general usage tracking with performance optimizations

### Backend Files:
- `/backend/src/services/UsageService.ts` - New service for usage calculations  
- `/backend/src/controllers/UsageController.ts` - Existing controller (already implemented)
- `/backend/src/routes/usage.ts` - Usage API routes (already implemented)

## ðŸŽ¯ Usage Limits by Plan

| Plan         | Inventory Limit | Team Members | Wallets |
|--------------|----------------|--------------|---------|
| Free         | 10 items       | 1 member     | 2       |
| Starter      | 100 items      | 3 members    | 5       |
| Professional | Unlimited      | Unlimited    | Unlimited |
| Enterprise   | Unlimited      | Unlimited    | Unlimited |

## ðŸš€ Performance Optimizations

1. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Usage data cached for 60 seconds
   - Background refresh every 5 minutes
   - No refetch on window focus

2. **API Call Reduction**:
   - Debounced sync operations (2 second delay)
   - Request deduplication for duplicate calls
   - Error handling to prevent unnecessary retries

3. **Real-time Sync**:
   - Automatic background sync when counts are out of sync
   - Manual sync button for immediate updates
   - Smart detection of count discrepancies

## ðŸ§ª Testing the Flow

To test the complete inventory limit flow:

1. **Add items to reach limit**:
   ```bash
   # Add 98+ items to get close to 100 item limit
   # Watch the stat card update in real-time
   ```

2. **Try to add 101st item**:
   - Click "Manual Entry" button
   - Should see upgrade modal instead of add form
   - Upgrade modal shows current: 100 / limit: 100

3. **Verify stat card synchronization**:
   - Delete an item
   - Watch usage count update automatically
   - Stat card should show "99 / 100" with green "1 remaining"

4. **Test bulk operations**:
   - Select multiple items and delete
   - Usage should sync automatically
   - Background sync should trigger if needed

## ðŸ”§ Debug Tools

Access browser console and use these functions:

```javascript
// Force refresh usage data
window.forceRefreshSubscription()

// Check current usage
window.usageDebug = true // (add this to localStorage)
```

## ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX Features

1. **Visual Indicators**:
   - Red text when at limit
   - Yellow text when near limit (80%+)
   - Green text when plenty available
   - Progress bar in usage display

2. **User Feedback**:
   - Toast notifications for all operations
   - Loading states during sync
   - Clear error messages
   - Upgrade prompts with benefits

## ðŸ“ˆ Monitoring

The system automatically logs:
- Usage sync operations
- Limit check failures
- API call performance
- Background sync triggers

Check browser console for detailed logs during development.

## ðŸ”„ Future Enhancements

1. Real-time WebSocket updates
2. Usage history tracking
3. Plan usage analytics
4. Automated upgrade suggestions
5. Bulk import limit checking
6. CSV import with limit validation
